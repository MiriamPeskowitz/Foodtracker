# Foodtracker

In Dec 2019-Jan 2020 I taught high school students how to program iOS apps in Swift 5/Xcode 11, which meant I had the chance to take my javaScript and Ruby/Rails knowledge
and use it to learn a new language and IDE. Foodtracker is the app you get by using the Apple Developer tutorial; it's a basic CRUD app that rates meals and gives them stars. 
The tutorial includes basic levels of persistence, something I was interested in. 

I used this app as a chance to practice pushing a Xcode-based project to a github repo. This article was helpful in showing the steps:
